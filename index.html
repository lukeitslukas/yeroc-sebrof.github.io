			Hi there!
			<br>
			My name is Corey, I'm a Ethical Hacker from Abertay University, Dundee. Whilst in university I have done quite a few projects, due to how many there are I decided it would be a good idea to list them out (Mainly so I don't forget). As you will see listed below, this website is a cut down version of my web application development module hand-in. This intends to be a more complete listing of my projects that I would consider worthwhile mentioning.
		</p>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
        	<p id="contentHead"><b>This Website - Web Application Development</b></p>

        	<p id="content">
						As previously mentioned this website is a reduced version of my module hand-in; I made this for my Web Application Development module in 2nd year but at the time it had more functionality. The website originally met a manditory feature list which included: HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, AJAX, and PHP. Since then the website has been subject to a significant overhaul. For this hand-in I received the grade: A (4.0)
					</p>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
        	<p id="contentHead"><b>Path Finding - Data Structures & Algorithms 1</b></p>

        	<p id="content">
						For both learning complex C++ and applying statistics during 2nd year of Ethical Hacking, I recreated two pathfinding algorithms and compared them. I wanted to compare Dijkstras algorithm to Lee algorithm. By seeding purely random maps to traverse then having both algorithms work through them each time eliminated any bias from the rand function in C++ or myself. For this I received the grade: B (3.0)
					</p>
	    </div>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
					<p id="contentHead"><b>Rainbow Table Generator - Data Structures & Algorithms 2</b></p>

					<p id="content">
						Completing my C++ modules in 2nd year of Ethical Hacking I had to make a program that met the requirement of containing self created multithreaded structures. For this I designed my own take on a basic farmer worker and used this to create a Rainbow Table generator that would hash a range of alphanumeric and special characters specified by the user. Using SHA-1 for hashing but this could be simply replaced, hashes would then be saved into a CSV file. For this I received the grade: B (3.0)
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
					<p id="contentHead"><b>Digital Forensics Report</b></p>

					<p id="content">
						The final module in my 2nd year of Ethical Hacking, which I enjoyed very much, required that I search for evidence of a crime commited on a John Doe's disk drive. We were then required to collect our findings into a court report along with a description of how to recreate the steps required to re-aquire all of the evidence discovered. For this I received the grade: B+ (3.5)
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
					<p id="contentHead"><b>Skeleton Key - Group Project (2 Parts)</b></p>

					<p id="content">
						The big module(s) from my 3rd year was my group project, this required us to decide on and develop a product as a team. For this, my team of four and I, decided to make a physical penetration device framework for the Raspberry Pi Zero W. We also made use of a USB stem and a Blinkt LED kit to make our device more accessable. We called our end product Skeleton Key (SK). This project, which can be found on GitHub, makes use of the Debian OS' kernel modules, these allow us to emulate generic devices when connected to a device via USB. We created a framework that lets us communicate with these OS modules via Python 3.6 allowing modules to be created for our device in Python.
						<br>
						For this framework we made four modules as examples; The first module being enumeration, made use of common tools for penetration testers to scan a predetermined range of devices and  generate a easy to read report using HTML and Bootstrap. Responder, the second module, makes use of SpiderLabs Responder to take password hashes from enterprise windows PC's and stores them on SK for later use. The next module, Storage, can make use of or generate a new file system which will be mounted over the USB connection to the device SK connected to. Finally, KeyInject makes use of our frameworks ability to both emulate a Keyboard and parse DuckyScript to read a user selected DuckyScript file and execute the contained instructions.

				There is always more to be written up and even more to be done but that's all my good projects for now.
