		<p>Hi there!<br>My name is Corey, I'm a Ethical Hacker from Dundee. I have done a whole bunch of projects during my time in Dundee, from that I decided it would be a good idea to list them out. As you will see listed below this website is a cut down version of my web application development module hand-in. This intends to be all of the projects that I would consider worthwhile mentioning in a chronological order.</p>

        	<p id="contentHead"><b>This Website</b></p>
        	<p id="content">As previously mentioned this website is a reduced version of my website; I made this for my Web Application Development module in 2nd year. The website originally met the manditory feature list which included: HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, AJAX, PHP. Since then the website has been subject to significant a overhaul. For this I received the grade: A (4.0)</p>
	    </div>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
        	<p id="contentHead"><b>Path Finding</b></p>
        	<p id="content">For learning C++ in 2nd year of Ethical Hacking I made an attempt at creating path finding algorithms. I wanted to compare Dijkstras algorithm to Lee algorithm. By seeding purely random maps to traverse and giving them to both algorithms each time this eliminated any bias from the rand function in C++ or by the writer. For this I received the grade: B (3.0)</p>
	    </div>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
					<p id="contentHead"><b>Rainbow Table Generator</b></p>
					<p id="content">Completing my C++ modules in 2nd year of Ethical Hacking I had to make a program that met the requirement of containing self created multithreaded structures. To furfil this I created a Rainbow Table generator that would hash a range of alphanumeric and special characters specified by the user using SHA-1 and save it into a CSV file. For this I received the grade: B (3.0)</p>
			</div>

			<div class="w3-row w3-padding-large">
					<p id="contentHead"><b>Forensics Report</b></p>
					<p id="content">The final module in 2nd year of Ethical Hacking that I enjoyed required that I search for evidence of a crime commited on a disk drive. We were then required to collect our findings into a court report along with how to recreate the steps required to re-aquire all of the evidence discovered. For this I received the grade: B+ (3.5)</p>

			<p>There is more to be written up and more to be done but that's all my good projects for now. If you would like any more information on my projects then the </p>
